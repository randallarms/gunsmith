Simply hold the item corresponding to the gun, and right click to fire. You will need the proper ammunition to fire a weapon, as well!

GunSmith works best with a custom resource pack that displays the base item (a diamond hoe) as the corresponding firearm. A specialty resource pack is included in our GitHub project repository, and can be directly downloaded here: https://github.com/randallarms/gunsmith/raw/master/resources/GunSmith%20%5BResources%5D.zip

Type "/guns" to use the gun selection menu.

Type "/giveGun <gunName>" to get a gun.
Type "/giveAmmo <gunName>" to get the corresponding ammunition for that gun (crossbows use bolts).
Add a player's name after that to send the item to that player.

Gun Names:

    "sniper" for a Sniper Rifle
    "br" for a Battle Rifle
    "lmg" for a Light Machine Gun
    "pistol" for a Pistol
    "bow" for a Crossbow
    "shotgun" for a Shotgun
    "ar" for an Assault Rifle
    "hmg" for a Heavy Machine Gun
