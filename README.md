#GunSmith
by Kraken

Simple custom gun plugin for Bukkit on Minecraft (MCv1.9).

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE: (Coming soon!)

GunSmith allows players to use certain in-game items as guns, firing them with the right-click button when the gun item is in your hand.

Currently features a Sniper Rifle (item: feather), Battle Rifle (item: wooden_hoe), and Pistol (golden_axe). To be added: SMGs, shotguns, and rocket launchers.

GunSmith works best with a custom resource pack that displays the base items as their corresponding firearm. A specialty resource pack may be added in the near future to facilitate players and servers using this plugin.

Any forks, branches, and pull requests are welcome! Please feel free to voice criticism to better the project, as well.
